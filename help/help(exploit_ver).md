We first start with scanning the ports. Nmap reveals that we have 3 open ports: 22, 80 and 3000. 
Trying to access port 3000 reveals by headers that it's a web application powered by express. I don't have expirience with it, therefore I decided to check port 80 first. Performing a deeper scan with nmap reveals its a web server powered by httpd. Straight away I checked for vulnerabilities for this version - only to find there are no sugnificant ones. 

I decided to run dirbuster in order to pick some interesting paths in the webserver (I used the medium wordlist provided by the tool):
```

Looking at /support reveals a ticket system called helpdeskz - searching via searchsploit reveals we have a remote file upload exploit: https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/40300

Okay, it seems that the programmer of the system didn't think much about the security of the upload function. Our plan will be as follows:
1. upload a php shell to the server
2. access that shell, thus activating it
3. gaining the user.txt
4. gaining the root.txt

We are going to exploit the function by guessing the time the file was uploaded (therefore, because the function ranges only between 0-300, we want to do it asap). The programmer hashed it with time as salt.

I used the first reverse shell I found in the internet and set my ip address in the internal vpn network as the target ip:
http://pentestmonkey.net/tools/web-shells/php-reverse-shell

then, when I tried to upload the file - I received the following error: `'We encountered a problem (cross-site request forgery detected); please try again.`
Going through the original code (which is located at https://github.com/evolutionscript/HelpDeskZ-1.0/) revealed that after 600 seconds the token is not valid anymore, therefore I need to upload the file faster. After doing that - I received a different error: **"FIle not allowed"**. This error got me stuck for hours. I found a couple of interesting function - verifyAttachment and verifyToken. However, it didn't make sense because .php files are supported in the system (in install.php) and the file is okay. Obviously uploading a different extension will give us nothing, we need that .php extension for the shell to work. I'm not familiar with php, so I began searching for the function the **actually** uploads the files. It seems that move_uploaded_files is the one we need. We can actually see that the programmer made it easy for us - the function is being called before the verifyAttachment() function, thus our file is actually in the server! it's in /support/uploads/tickets/

Couldn't believe I have spend hours on this one, while all the time it was infront of me. Anyway, reading the exploit we want to specify the name of the file and the basename. Before that, let's setup our reverse shell listener:
```
root@kali:~# nc -nlvp 1234
listening on [any] 1234 ...
```
Now we run the script and we can see that our shell becomes alive:
```
root@kali:~# python exploit.py http://10.10.10.121/support/uploads/tickets/ reverse_shell.php
Helpdeskz v1.0.2 - Unauthenticated shell upload exploit
```
On other tab:

Now let's get our root:
Again, let's see if we have an exploit for the current linux kernel, therefore we first must check the version:
```
$ uname -a

```
Okay, now let's see if we have an exploit for that version:
```

Great, local privilege escalation, exactly what we need. We will compile it first:
```
gcc /usr/share/exploitdb/exploits/linux/local/44298.c -o exploit.php
```
now we want to upload our file and then download it via our shell:
```

That was relatively easy. At the end this machine was quite challanging, but required only knowledge in using kali's tools. I'll post the second version which has more challange into it.
